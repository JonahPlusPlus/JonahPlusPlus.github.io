Hey, Jonah here. With the release of bevy_atmosphere 0.4 (for bevy 0.8), I thought I would take the time to write a short article about the experience and technical details. Source code can be found at [JonahPlusPlus/bevy_atmosphere]("https://github.com/JonahPlusPlus/bevy_atmosphere").

bevy_atmosphere is a procedural sky plugin for the Bevy game engine. It offers complete customization of the sky simulation, allowing for any number of effects (see Figure 1).
