# Project 1

The goal of this project was to write instructions for some topic.
Around this time I was learning about Stable Diffusion, an image generation AI, so I decided to write some instructions on how to set it up and use it to create some cool images.

# Project 2

The goal of this project was to create job searching materials, including a resume, cover letter, and a mini interview video.
I decided to make these materials for a Junior Software Engineer position at Boeing.

# Project 3

The goal of this project was to make a Student Research Grant proposal.
The research topic I chose was the viability of a peer-to-peer network architecture for multiplayer video games, something I've been researching on my free time.
